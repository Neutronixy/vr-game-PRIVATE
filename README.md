# VR Game (PRIVATE)
This video showcases VRush, an indie VR game Iâ€™m developing in Unity.

The game challenges players to dodge or break through obstacles coming from all directions at increasing speeds, using their whole body and hand gestures to trigger magical abilities.

Players can adjust the game area without limits, keeping the gameplay balanced and enabling freedom of movement, making it a breakthrough in the e-sports VR industry.

It supports both standard and standalone full-body tracking, but can also be played without trackers. It is compatible with PC via SteamVR and all Android-based headsets.
